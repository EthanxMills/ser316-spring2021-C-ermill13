Questions (up to 2x 10min a pop then ext):

    A: Vision is guides for bias motivated indicents. (super inclusive and thoughtful holy shit)
How would you describe your leadership style?
    A: Individually catered.
What personal quality have you found to be most valuable during your time as a President thus far?
    A: Patience and a desire to learn.

Discussion:
Thank you both for your bids. ASU Poly values multiple points both sides offer such as Emery's exstensive consideration of minority groups and
Nathaniel's consideration of Mental Health Advocacy. Both candidates posses a visible fever for being active in the region and is confident either
one would make an incredible C O P RHA, but would toss their hat behind Emery due to their clarity of action items and emphasis on patience as a 
leadership quality

Decision:
Emery overall seems better but their points seem better suited for an advocacy chair position, Nathaniel seems more dedication to the Presidential
support end of the spectrum.
